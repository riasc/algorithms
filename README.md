## Search Algorithms
### Binary Search (a/k/a half-interval search or logarithmic search)
Implementation of the binary search in different languages. The underlying
data structure is a simple array. It runs at worst logarithmic time, making
`O(log n)` comparisons, where `n` in the number of elements in the array.
